      <description> Find common ground. This may not be easy at first but if you focus on their goals and emotions you will probably find something in common.
For example:
 ‘I agree, I&amp;rsquo;m realy worried that in the future the NHS won&amp;rsquo;t be there for me and my family.’

      <description>Share your personal point of view. Focus on the personal impact of Brexit on you or your family.
How does this subject impact you and your family?
For example:
 Less money for the NHS
‘We are not going to get the extra £350 million a week for the NHS that we were promised.
Even Nigel Farage said he could not guarantee we would get that money.
How is the NHS going to be there for me and my family with less money?</description>
