<p>Focus on the personal impact of Brexit on you or your family.</p>

<p>How does this subject impact you and your family?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Less money for the NHS</strong></p>

<p>‘We are not going to get the extra £350 million a week for the NHS that we were promised.</p>

<p>Even Nigel Farage said he could not guarantee we would get that money.</p>

<p>How is the NHS going to be there for me and my family with less money?’</p>
</blockquote>
